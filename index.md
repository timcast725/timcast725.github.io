## About me

My name is Timothy Castiglia. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2017 and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the same university. My graduation is expected to be in May 2023. 

## Research

My work is focused on Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning scenario with several
clients and a parameter server collaboratively training a global model for a predictive task. 
In an FL scenario, training data is privately owned by the clients, and the data distribution
is imposed on the system. FL scenarios often face high communication costs,
due to high message latency, power limitations, or network restrictions. My ongoing work is focused
around designing FL algorithms to provide client data privacy, to accommodate for different FL data
distributions, and to be communication-efficient by design. My work provides theoretical convergence
analysis of these algorithms, as well as empirical evidence of their improvements over existing FL algorithms.
